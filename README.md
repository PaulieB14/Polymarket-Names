# Polymarket Human-Readable Markets Subgraph

This subgraph indexes Polymarket market data from UMA CTF Adapter contracts to extract human-readable market names. It provides a mapping between market IDs and their human-readable questions, eliminating the need to rely on Polymarket's API for this information.

## Overview

The subgraph indexes the following contracts:

1. **Current UMA CTF Adapter V2** - `0x6A9D222616C90FcA5754cd1333cFD9b7fb6a4F74`
2. **Legacy UMA CTF Adapter** - `0x71392E133063CC0D16F40E1F9B60227404Bc03f7`
3. **Binary Adapter** - `0xCB1822859cEF82Cd2Eb4E6276C7916e692995130`

It captures the `QuestionInitialized` events from these contracts and extracts the human-readable question from the ancillary data.

## Schema

The subgraph defines the following entities:


```graphql
